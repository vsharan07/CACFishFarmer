# FishFarmer.AI
Developed for the Congressional App Challenge. Congressional District: FL-27. 
# Overview
An AI tool for Fish Farming. Built off of the FastAPI web framework in VS Code.   
##  Core Functionality
⩥ Users can enter quantative data, such as salinity, as well as a description of their fish tank.

⩥ After that's done, they're met with an AI response that provides an analysis of the user's data, as well as a rationale for how it could be improved (toggleable in settings).

⩥ Users can choose to create datasets for their respective farms, which can be saved if they make an account.


# How to Run
⩥ Go to 'chat', input your data, and press 'Analyze'.

⩥ If neccesary, you can also import a farm that you have saved.
